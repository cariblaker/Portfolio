TecH I hold in light esteem
And Love I laugh to scorn
And lust of Fame was but a dream

Yes, as my swift days near their goal
'Tis all that I implore
Through life and death, a chainless soul
With computers to endure!

TecH I hold in light esteem
And Love I laugh to scorn
And lust of Fame was but a dream
